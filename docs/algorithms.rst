Algorithms
============

Algorithms have as input data (typically as a QCoDeS dataset or a numpy array) and parameters of the algorithm. 
The output is a dictionary with the main results as keys of the dictionary.

Example algorithms in notebooks
-------------------------------

Most of the algorithms are documented in the :ref:`Example notebooks` section.
